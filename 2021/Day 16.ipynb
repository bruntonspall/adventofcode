    "# Day 16 Binary decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow this is a long description.  The first thing to catch my eye here is that some of the analysis is going to cross byte boundaries.  So in the example packet, bits 7-12 are the first number, and crosses the 8bit boundary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to need to turn the hexedecimal start into a binary stream and then start processing that stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing that I notice is that we've got the concept of a packet and a `subpacket`, and I'm immedietely suspicious that our subpackets themselves might contain their own subpackets.  That could be recursive, so our packet parser is going to have to think about how to represent that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our question asks us to only create the sum of the packet versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, I think what I'm going to do is use some python classes, mostly because I haven't done that yet, and partly because this lets us use a pattern around decompposition.  If we have a Packet class, it can contain a list of subpackets.  Each packet class can encode the data we care about, so version, type.  We can store data if there is any (the operators don't seem to have their own data, but literal value packets do). We can then ask a packet for it's VersionChecksum, which will add together all the VersionChecksums of the subpackets and add it;s own version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we're going to need a parse function that takes a set of bytes and parses them as a bitstream.  There's several ways of doing this, but the easiest in python is to use the bitstring package.  I thought I'd use it in Day 3 but I never ended up needing it.  bitstream has got a neat ability to consume bits of the stream, make decisions and then interpret the next chunk of the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give the classes a define first and then try parsing a literal value from a class first"
