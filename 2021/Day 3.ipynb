    "Oh dear, from first glance this is going to be all about binary.  Last year I discovered a python package, `bitstring` that can make it easier to work with bit strings, but it's annoying that Python doesn't handle bitstrings by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right, so we're doing two things at once, firstly we're looking for the most common bit in a stream.  Secondly, we're looking at bits in columns rather than each individual word\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm super tempted at this point to transpose the lines around.  Transposition is a way of taking `[1,2,3]` and `[4,5,6]` and turning it into `[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]`.  If we did that, we'd be able to then read along a single list and count frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way to do this is to go down the bitstreams, one at a time and keep a count of 1's and 0's in each line.  Since we want to know how many we have, we could treat 1's as +1 and 0's as -1, and then at the end, if the total is positive, it's a 1, and if it's negative it's a 0.\n",

    "Let's try that slightly simpler way instead of fancy transposition"

    "    \n",
    "Anyway, our next step is to find the gamma rate, which is just the epsilon rate in reverse.  Now we could rerun out algorithm with a different sum at the end.  But we also know that if it's the opposite, then the number will just be the bitwise negation of the result.\n",
