    "Ok.  I nearly didn't start this one.  I took a look at the puzzle, and thought \"I can work out how to simulate the probe but I've got no idea how to work out the best start value\".  This feels like I should be able to solve with maths somehow, like reason about the graph, solve for the intercept and there is it.  Except that my maths isn't strong enough to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I then started dreaming about it, and thinking about it idly, and an idea came to me, an idea that I want to try out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Todays solution is going to be far more functional than previous weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "My idea was to write a simple function that can take the initial variables and calculate each successive step each time its called.\n",
    "For any given start values, we can then generate an infinite stream of coordinates.\n",
    "We're going to then filter that stream for anything that goes outside our bounds, that's the edge of the target box, or above an arbitrary height or behind the sub.\n",
    "Finally we'll search that stream for the maximum y coordinate.  That will give us a mapping of start settings to maximum y.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then have some settings that we can play with.  We're going to need to explore the solution space for those settings, but we won't know whats possible.  At a gut feel, based on the numbers, anything that has an x-increment of more than half the total x bound is pointless, as we wont have more than 1 point in the stream.\n",
    "On the y coordinate test, I don't really know what a sensible number is, so lets try around -1000 to 1000 and see if that works\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's a thought.  I don't actually ever think I want an infinite range, stuff with infinite loops makes me nervous, so I'm going to hardcode a global MAX_ITERATIONS of around 1000.  That should be plenty"
