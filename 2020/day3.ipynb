    "We have to take a string that represents a tobogan run, trees and then plot a route down the tobogan run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key things to note today:\n",
    "1. The run extends horizontally infinitely\n",
    "2. Each tree will repeat as the run repeats\n",
    "3. We need to parse a kind of map to work out where the trees are\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we start with the assumption that we'll parse the array, and caclulate something that looks like:\n",
    "`{\n",
    "0: [2, 3]\n",
    "1: [5, 9]\n",
    "}` as the tree data, indicating that in row 0, there are trees at x=2, and x=3, then in row 1 there are trees at x=5, and x=9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the additional data of how often to repeat (the stride of the run), and you'll have a tree at x=2, x=2+repeat, x=2+repeat+repeat etc...\n",
    "It's helpful to realise that you don't need to count repeats, that's the same as `x % stride`, or x mod stride.  Remember, mobular arithmatic is like a clock, each time you reach the mod limit, you reset to 0, so `2 % 10 == 12 % 10 == 22 % 10 == 282 % 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we don't need to calculate all of these, we just need a function that can say \"For point `x,y`, is there a tree\"...\n",

    "\n",
    "there's two ways we can do this, if we know that we are going to follow a simple rational slope of right 3, down 1 (which is what my puzzle input says), then we can define that as `dx=3, dy=1`, and simply iterate doing `x=x+dx, y=y+dy` until `dy > height`.  That's probbaly the easiest.  I have a strong suspicion that part 2 will either require us to count trees inbetween, or will need us to test a range of slopes, so lets make a function that counts the trees for a given slope in dx,dy and see what happens"

So if your dictionary is empty calling d[\"foo\"] will return you the new default object.  If those are empty lists, you can just call append on it, and modify the list in place, and the code is the same regardless of whether you've seen an element before.  No more \"if has X, new list, else append to list\" gubbins"
