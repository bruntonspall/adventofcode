    "# Day 11 Like a game of life\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a much simplified version of Conways game of life, a coding pattern that we used for years at the Guardian when interviewing individuals.  This is a little easier, because we have fewer rules, and no concerns around infinite or wrapping maps or anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest part here, from experience, is working out how to count the neighbours of a cell.  There's lots of ways to do this, but since I've done it before it shouldn't be too bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key for finding the count of the neighbours is to work out how we are going to address the cells.  My games experience makes me tend to address cells by cartesian coordinates, x and y.  That means to find neighbours we want to find the cells addressed by x-1, y-1 through to x+1, y+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we need to handle cells at the edge of the map.  Instead of reaching directly into the data structure, we call getCell(x,y) which if we address outside the board, will just always return false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our third oddity here compared to Conways Game of Life is that not all cells can be occupied.  Some cells have a seat, and can either be occupied, or empty, or floor.  We'll represent those as a tristate variable, 0 = floor, 1=emptyseat, 2=occupied.\n",
