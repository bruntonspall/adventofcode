# Day 9 Part 1

Ok, this looks like a fun little problem.  We have a dense format that is designed to represent memory layout, so 995989 represents a 9 block file (with id 0) at location 0, a 9 block space, a 5 block file with id 1 at location 18, a 9 block space, an 8 block file with id 2 starting at location 32, and then 9 blocks of space.

There's a cute visual representation which I think might be a bit of a red herring, but dense representation `2333133121414131402` should look like

```
00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
```

We defrag and make space by moving blocks from the end of memory to the first available free space.
Critically, we need to remember the original ID's as well, as our checksum at the end is each blocks ID multiplied by its position.

## How to approach this

There's lots of potentially smart things we can do, but the brute force and simple technique here might be to do as the example has done, and represent the in memory blocks as bytes.  I note that in the example above we conveniently have 18 digits, meaning the numbers 1 to 9 can be used in the representation, but looking at my input, we're afect about 20,000 characters, so we need to consider going up to around 10,000 for our ID.
We're going to be doing lots of swaps, which is in theory inefficient, but we can probably worry about that later.

My bigger initial worry was just how big this space gets.  Any puzzle that has a compressed input has a potential to ask you to allocate terrabytes of RAM if you aren't careful.

With 20,000 digits, if every single one was a 9, we'd be looking at around 9 memory spaces for every digit, so 9*20,000 so only about 200,000 bytes which is less than half a megabyte.  I think we're fine, but I'm keeping an eye on that in case it bites me later.

So if we're fine with it, we're going to go for the simplest thing that works:
Unpack the dense array into a memory array, which is a vector of u16's representing each block in memory and the file id stored in it.
Run a defragment algorithm, which will proceed along the blocks looking for spaces (whcih reminds me, we need a special value for representing free space), and when it finds one, grabbing the last full space.
Finally, generate a checksum and return it.

Let's give that a go with sample input and see if we can generate a memory array that looks right.
