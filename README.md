In 2019, I'm trying to solve these using Go.  Template taken from https://github.com/kindermoumoute/adventofcode, and tweaked.

In 2020, I did these in iPython Notebook (or Jupyter), and [published HTML outputs](https://bruntonspall.github.io/adventofcode/2020/) from each notebook

In 2021, I did it again in iPython Notebook and [published the HTML outputs](https://bruntonspall.github.io/adventofcode/2021/).

In 2023, I did it again in IPython Notebook because I really like the interactive nature of code and markdown combined.  You can find [the HTML outputs as always](https://bruntonspall.github.io/adventofcode/2023)
